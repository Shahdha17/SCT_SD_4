## 🤖 Task 04 - Universal Web Scraper 🌐📊 (SCT_SD_4)

This is *Task 4* of my Software Development Internship at *SkillCraft Technology*.

### 👩‍💻 Task Details  
Created a **Python GUI-based web scraping tool** that allows users to extract product information (like name, price, and rating) from any valid e-commerce URL. If no structured product data is found, the scraper falls back to extracting general content. The application provides options to select the output folder, name the CSV file, and view real-time logs during the scraping process. This task focuses on GUI building, data scraping, and content structuring.

### 🚀 Features  
✅ Universal URL input support  
✅ Automated detection of product Name, Price, and Rating  
✅ Intelligent fallback to general content scraping  
✅ CSV export with custom filename  
✅ Browse and select output folder  
✅ Live status updates via log area  
✅ Error handling for invalid URLs or connection issues  
✅ Simple and responsive user interface using ttk

### 🧠 Concepts Used  
- Tkinter and ttk for GUI  
- requests module for fetching webpages  
- BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML  
- csv module for exporting data  
- Regular expressions for pattern matching  
- Heuristic parsing and fallback handling  
- Event-driven GUI programming  
- Exception handling and input validation

### 📁 File
